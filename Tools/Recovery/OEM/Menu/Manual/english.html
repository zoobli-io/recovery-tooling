		  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
		  <h3 id="welcome">Welcome</h3>
			<p>Hi! And welcome the computer recovery tools manual!</p>
			<p>Your system integrator has installed a collection of tools which, combined with the powerful tools already present in Windows 1X, will assure you peace of mind knowing you will always have options to be back on track rapidly if anything happens to your Windows installation.</p>
			<p>If not already done, we recommend you to immediately create a recovery media by following the instructions in the <a href="#rm_creation">corresponding section</a>.</p>

				</ul>
				It also gives some more options normally not found in Windows like:

			<img src="./images/english/tools-mainmenu.png"/>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-winre.bmp"/> will launch the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), which is a built-in repair environment in Windows 1X that allows you to do various operation on your Windows installation, like <a href="#re_bootrepair">repairing problems that prevent Windows from booting normally</a> and <a href="#re_reset">resetting Windows</a> (Windows reinstallation). An <a href="#re_browser">offline file browser</a> (to access files from an unbootable system) has also been added.</p>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-recoverymedia.bmp"/> will launch the recovery media creator. A recovery media allows you to fully <a href="#rm_reinstall">reinstall Windows</a> on a new hard-drive or when the Windows Recovery Environment is unable to repair Windows. Please note that the recovery media do not allows you to keep your personal files. We recommends you to <a href="#rm_creation">create a recovery media</a> a soon as possible.</p>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-systemrestore.bmp"/> will launch the Windows System Restore panel which allows you to <a href="#rp">revert back changes</a> made by Windows Updates, newly installed applications or drivers.</p>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-filehistory.bmp"/> will launch the File History panel which allows you to <a href="#fh_config">configure a periodic backup</a> of your personal files on a USB drive or <a href="#fh_restore">restore files</a> previously saved on it.</p>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-antivirus.bmp"/>, if enabled by your system integrator, will launch an independent antivirus which can help you <a href="#av_scan">detect and removes infected files</a> in case your main security software became corrupted or stopped working. This application do not provide live protection and should be only used in case of emergency. Please note that you will have to <a href="#av_update">update the detection catalog</a> on first use, so a working Internet connection is required.</p>
			<p>Clicking on <img src="./images/english/tools-undelete.bmp"/>, if enabled by your system integrator, will launch a software to help you <a href="#fu">recover accidently deleted files</a> from your computer.</p>

		  <h2>Recovery environment</h2>
			<p>Windows 1X come with the Windows Recovery Environment, a small application outside Windows that can help you diagnose and repair Windows. You can use it to fix booting problems, reinstall Windows and go back to a previous restore point. An offline file browser to quickly copy files to and from this computer to a USB drive is also included with the help of the computer recovery tools installed by your system integrator.</p>
			<p>The Windows Recovery Environment can be accessed from the <a href="#tools_mainmenu">main menu</a> directly or automatically after 3 failed boot attempts.</p>
		  <h3 id="re_bootrepair">Boot repair</h3>
			<p>If Windows cannot boot correctly, you can try the following options.</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-mainmenu.png"/>
			<p>First, click on "Troubleshoot".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-troubleshoot.png"/>
			<p>Then, click on "Advanced options".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-advancedoptions.png"/>
			<p>Finally, click on "Startup Repair" and follow the instructions.</p>
			<p>You can also try the "System Restore" option to go back to a previous restore point to fix problems made by newly installed updates, applications or drivers.</p>
		  <h3 id="re_reset">Reset the computer</h3>
			<p>If your computer cannot be repaired (or if you simply start from fresh) you can also reinstall Windows through the recovery environment. To do so, please follow theses steps.</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-mainmenu.png"/>
			<p>First, click on "Troubleshoot".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-troubleshoot.png"/>
			<p>Then, click on "Reset this PC".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-reset.png"/>
			<p>You can then decide to keep your personal files (music, documents, pictures, etc.) or delete everything for a clean install. In both cases, all applications (except the one pre-installed by your system integrator) will be deleted.</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-reset-source.png"/>
			<p>Finally, you can select the "Cloud download" to use the latest Windows 1X version (direct Internet connection required, Wi-Fi not available) or "Local reinstall" to use the same version currently installed on the computer. This will take time and your computer will reboot a few times.</p>
		  <h3 id="re_browser">File browser</h3>
			<p>If your computer cannot boot and you quickly need access to your files (to continue working on another computer by example) you can use the file browser that has been incorporated by your system integrator into the recovery environment. Please connect a USB drive (HDD, Flash drive, etc.) before continuing.</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-mainmenu.png"/>
			<p>First, click on "Troubleshoot".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-troubleshoot.png"/>
			<p>Then, click on "Advanced tools".</p>
			<img src="./images/english/re-advancestools.png"/>
			<p>Finally, click on "File browser". You will then have access to all the files of your computer and you will then be able to copy them to or from an USB drive.</p>

		  <h3 id="rm_creation">Creating recovery media</h3>
			<p>From the computer recovery tools menu, click on <img src="./images/english/tools-recoverymedia.bmp"/> and follow the on-screen instruction. Since your system integrator may have opted-out of some available option no visual instructions will be provided since this is a generic documentation.</p>
